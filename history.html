        <h2>The Origins of Sign Language</h2>

        <p>
          The recorded history of sign language in Western societies starts in
          the 17th century, but references to hand gesture communication date
          back as far as 5th century BC Greece. Sign language is composed of
          conventional gestures, mimic, hand signs, and finger spelling. It uses
          hand positions to represent the alphabet and can convey complete ideas
          or phrases.

        <p>
          Many sign languages have developed independently throughout the world,
          and no first sign language can be identified. Both signed systems and
          manual alphabets have existed globally. Historically, documentation is
          mostly limited to manual alphabets used to transfer words from oral to
          sign language.

          Juan Pablo Bonet's work in the 17th century was one of the earliest
          efforts to formalize sign language education. In 1620, he published a
          book outlining the use of a manual alphabet for teaching speech to the
          deaf. In Paris, Abbé Charles Michel de l'Épée established the first
          school for the deaf, leading to the development of French Sign
          Language. American Sign Language (ASL) is heavily based on this
          system.

        <p>
          In Native American communities, sign languages were used as a lingua
          franca for trade, ceremonies, and storytelling. Plains Indian Sign
          Language is an example of a complex system used by both deaf and
          hearing members for communication.

        <h2>The Evolution of Sign Language Education</h2>

        <p>
          Throughout history, the education of deaf individuals has shifted
          between using sign language and oral methods. In 1880, the Milan
          Conference favored oralism, which discouraged the use of sign language
          in education. However, modern research has shown that early exposure
          to sign language helps with language acquisition and cognitive
          development in deaf children.

        <p>
          Today, sign languages are recognized as full-fledged languages.
          Schools now adopt a "Total Communication" philosophy, which includes
          the use of both oral and signed methods. American Sign Language,
          British Sign Language, and many others have been fully developed and
          continue to evolve.
